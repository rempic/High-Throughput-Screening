## [Data preparation 1 (show): TECHNICAL and CONSISTENCY corrections](https://cdn.rawgit.com/rempic/High-Throughput-Screening/master/Data_Managment/data_cleaning.html)

The goal of this module is to clean the raw data obtained from the [data extraction](/Data_Extraction). in particular the data cleaning consists of TECHNICAL and CONSISTENCY corrections of the data. 

    Validation of the attributes names and number

    Check that the number of columns of numerical attributes is consistent with what is expected

    Show whether there is any column with special characters (NA, NaN, Null, Inf, -Inf)

    Change found special caracters with a specific numeircal value

    Check whether there are inconsistent attributes values, e.g, negative values

The code is written in R environment. This repository folder contains 
- the [R-code](./data_cleaning.Rmd)
- [a raw data sample file](./RAW_DATA_SAMPLE.txt) obtained by the [data extraction](/Data_Extraction) module
- a [R-Markdown](https://cdn.rawgit.com/rempic/High-Throughput-Screening/master/Data_Managment/data_cleaning.html) with code and description of the data cleaning workflow.  

Open the R-Markdown for more details about the workflow: [Data Cleaning](https://cdn.rawgit.com/rempic/High-Throughput-Screening/master/Data_Managment/data_cleaning.html)


## [Data preparation 2: machine learning classifier (show)](https://cdn.rawgit.com/rempic/MACHINE-LEARNING-Edge-Cells-classifier/master/PIPELINE/1_DATA_PREPARATION1.html)

- Clean and Visualize features and relative stats
- Transform features: substitute values and normalization of absolute values
- Shuffle and split the data-set in training and test sets
- Save trainging and test data(cross validation will be performed directly on images)
- r code: PIPELINE/1_DATA_PREPARATION1.rmd

## [Data preparation 3: machine learning classifier (show)](https://cdn.rawgit.com/rempic/MACHINE-LEARNING-Edge-Cells-classifier/master/PIPELINE/2_DATA_PREPARATION2_NORM_RESCAL.html)
- Normalize distributions (e.g, log transformation)
- Rescaling features
- Save: transformed data set, mean and stdev of features to be used for testing and cross validation 
- r code: PIPELINE/2_DATA_PREPARATION2_NORM_RESCAL.rmd

In the sub-folder "1_DATA to 3_DATA" find the files with 
  - original data
  - prepared data  
  - shuffle and split data for training and test sets
  - tranformed data (log and rescaling)
  - mean and stdev features from transformed data
