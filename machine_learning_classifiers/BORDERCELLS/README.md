# Classifier: cells at the edges

The goal of this classifier is to identify the cells at the edges of the population. An example of cells (nuclei) located at edges of the monolayer is shown below (marked in red). In this folder you find the "data preparation", the algorithm for "logistic regression" and "visualization of results"

In the sub-folder "1_DATA_PREPARATION" find the files with 
  - original data
  - prepared data  
  - shuffle and split data for training and test sets
  - r code
