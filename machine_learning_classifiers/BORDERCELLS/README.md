# Classifier: cells at the edges

The goal of this classifier is to identify the cells at the edges of the population. An example of cells (nuclei) located at edges of the monolayer is shown below (red outlines in the figure below). In this folder you can find the "data preparation" and the algorithm for "logistic regression":
